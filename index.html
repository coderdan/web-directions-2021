          <h2><em>Why?</em></h2>
          <aside class="notes">
            The first question you should probably ask is why would we even want to do cryptography in the browser?

          <aside class="notes">
            A good answer to this question comes from considering a model of trust in modern web computing.
            In most applications, the web-backend is a trusted actor. While network communications are encrypted,
            the web backend typically has access to unencrypted information. So, in any security model, we must ask,
            can the web backend be trusted.

          <aside class="notes">
            By encrypting in the browser, with keys controlled by the individual, we can effectively remove the web backend from
            the trust model.

          <aside class="notes">
            So what is the state of cryptography in the browser? There are 2 main options.
            Web Assembly say using a language like Rust, or the new Web Crypto standard.

            The main interface to the Web Crypto API is called SubtleCrypto. This is to avoid naming clashes with older
            (and insecure) modules simply called crypto. But also to remind us that it is easy to make subtle but nonetheless
            devastating mistakes with cryptography. There be demons.

            One other small gotcha is that Web Crypto only works when the browser is connected via HTTPS (probably for obvious reasons).

            There are 2 main forms of encryption - symmetric and assymetric. Cryptography is a big topic
            and we only have only around 20 minutes so I'm going to just focus on symmetric encryption but I _will_

            There are also many flavours of symmetric encryption but by far the most common and trusted symmetric cipher is Advanced Encryption Standard

            Encrypting a message with AES has 3 required steps and an additional optional step.
            I'll run through how to correctly encode a message, create a key and safely generate an initalisation vector
            using the latest web crypto API running in the browser.

            Let's start with encoding. We can't just encrypt a string directly with web crypto.
            We first have to encode the message into a consistent binary format.
            To do that we'll instantiate a new text encoder
            and pass the message to the encode function.

            Next we need to either load or generate a key.
            AES keys can be 128, 192 or 256 bits in length.
            256-bits will be the most secure but applies more encryption rounds (10 vs 14) and so will take longer.
            Note, that the block size does not change with different key sizes so using a larger
            key doesn't result in a larger ciphertext. It's only really performance you're trading off here.
            Also remember that because AES is symmetric you use the same key to both encrypt and decrypt.

  ["encrypt", "decrypt"] // Allowed usage

          <aside class="notes">
            We can use the SubtleCrypto interface to generate a key in the browser.
            The generateKey function returns a promise and takes 3 arguments.
            The first is an object specifying the encryption mode (which we'll explain later)
            and the key size. Think of this as the "algorithm" specifier.
            The second argument indicates whether we can export the key for later use
            and the final argument tells the API what operations are allowed with this instance of the key.
            Might want limit the use.

            To understand why, let's look at an example.
            I have a simple database that stores product purchases along with the encrypted
            email address of a buyer using a deterministic scheme (e.g. AES in ECB).
            <br/>
            Notice that one of the encrypted email addresses repeats. That means the person who bought
            a Pizza, also bought chocolate! We've learned something about the data.
            <br/>
            If an attacker was able to determine the encryption of an email address, they can find all
            coresponding purchases. This is known as a chosen plaintext attack and there are many
            examples of large amounts of data being leaked because of them.

            So how do we choose each IV so that it is never repeated?
            The first option is to use a counter that we increment every time we encrypt.
            This approach is generally fine but you must be careful to ensure the counter never resets.
            Managing counters in distributed or multiuser systems like ..._the web_ can be hard, too
            so another approach is preferred when using web crypto.

            However, after a billion encryptions the probability of a repeated IV jumps to 2.7%.
            <br/>
            That sounds like a lot of encryptions. But consider that 1-billion, 16-byte blocks is only 16GB.
            If you encrypt a 1 TB SSD using this approach you'd get a lot of repeated IVs which gives a
            motivated attacker plenty of advantage.

            that attackers can often guess the numbers that they generate. Non-cryptrographically secure random number generators

            As we'll see later, web crypto does the hard work for us but it can be helpful to know what's
            going on under the hood. Some padding schemes have been shown to be vulnerable to attacks
